Turing Simulator
======

A Turing Machine simulator implemented in Pascal using Delphi 7 (ancient & proprietary, I know).

Disclaimer:
This is not what my code usually looks like. This was written as a project for a school course which required the tool to be developed in Pascal using an at least suboptimal input file format.
It might also be worth noting that I hate Delphi / Pascal with a passion. So, if you are my future employer: This is not good code. I usually do better. Thanks.
